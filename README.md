# Strings and Arithmetic

This project will help you practice the skills and concepts you learned related to String and Arithmetic Operators

### Download the Playground

1. Download the playground for this project by clicking [here](https://github.com/LambdaSchool/StringsAndArithmetic/archive/master.zip). 
2. Unzip the downloaded file.
3. Open the included StringsArithmetic.playground file using Xcode or if you are using Windows or Linux, use the instructions below in your code editor of choice.

### Do the Excercises

This project consists of multiple pages. You can see all the pages by choosing View->Navigators->Show Navigators in the View menu in Xcode.

1. Complete all the excercises on the first page.
2. Go to the next page by clicking the "Next" link at the bottom of the playground, or by selecting it in the files navigator on the left side.
3. Repeat until you've completed all pages in the playground.

## Instructions:

These instructions are the exact same as the ones in the playground for the convenience of those who are not able to use Xcode.

### String Literals
Create a string literal constant introducing yourself. Your introduction should include your name, where you're from, what you like to do for fun, and why you decided to do Lambda School.

###  Multiline String Literal
Create a multiline string literal constant of a 1-paragraph letter to Lambda School on why you'd be a great candidate for the program.

### String Concatenation
Create a constant for your favorite vacation destination. Using string concatenation, print out a string that says "I love to travel to [favorite travel destination]."

### String Interpolation
Using the constant you created above, print out the same string: "I love to travel to [favorite travel destination]." using string interpolation

### Calorie Goal
Below you have constants for the number of calories you burned each day over the last week. Using simple arithmetic find the average number of calories burned. Add 100 calories to the average and use string interpolation to print out "Your new move goal for the week is [your calculated goal].

```Swift
let mondayCalories = 340
let tuesdayCalories = 420
let wednedayCalories = 200
let thursdayCalories = 625
let fridayCalories = 500
let saturdayCalories = 1_090
let sundayCalories = 300
```

## Submit your finished work after you've completed all the excercises.
